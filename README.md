# CSCI-335-03-Group-03

Abstract: Our project aims to identify the
sentiment of various tweets. We accomplish this goal
using SVM and BERT models. This allows us to
compare the effectiveness of these different models at NLP sentiment
analysis.

Developers: 

Cameron Kline:

- data collection
- BERT model
    
Edison Pan:

- data preprocessing
- SVM model


To run the project, simply run the python files. They will train the model
and print out it's performance metrics. The best model
will then be saved in its own file.
